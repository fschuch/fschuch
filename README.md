### About

I've been working in Computational Fluid Dynamics research for about ten years, applying and also developing tools that are often powered by High-Performance Computing (HPC).
I bring with me the experience of solving complex problems employing computational tools, besides processing, visualizing, and communicating the data produced by these solutions.

My main interests are Software Development and related topics (Python and Fortran), High-performance computing, parallel computing, numerical methods, data science, data visualization, and technical writing.

### Highlights

* Open-source contributions:
  * [XCompact3d](www.github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d) (*Member of the development Team*): A Fortran-MPI based, finite difference high-performance code for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and as many as you need scalar transport equations;
  * [XCompact3d-toolbox](www.github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox) (*Core developer*): A Python package with many tools for pre and postprocessing prepared for the high-order Navier-Stokes solver XCompact3d;
  * [CFDPython](www.github.com/fschuch/CFDPython-BR) (*Translated to Portuguese*): A sequence of Jupyter notebooks featuring the "12 Steps to Navier-Stokes".
