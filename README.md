### About

I've been working in Computational Fluid Dynamics research for about ten years, applying and also developing tools that are often powered by High-Performance Computing (HPC).
I bring with me the experience of solving complex problems employing computational tools, besides processing, visualizing, and communicating the data produced by these solutions.

My main interests are Software Development and related topics (Python and Fortran), High-performance computing, parallel computing, numerical methods, data science, data visualization, and technical writing.

### Highlights

* Open-source contributions:
  * [XCompact3d](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d) (*Member of the development Team*): A Fortran-MPI based, finite difference high-performance code for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and as many as you need scalar transport equations;
  * [XCompact3d-toolbox](https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox) (*Core developer*): A Python package with many tools for pre and postprocessing prepared for the high-order Navier-Stokes solver XCompact3d.

* Reasearch results:
  * [Plunging Criterion](https://github.com/fschuch/incompact3d_plunging_criterion): This repository contains the source code and dataset from our work "Plunging condition for particle-laden flows over sloping bottoms: three-dimensional turbulence-resolving simulations" (Computers & Geosciences, 2021);
  * [The Plunging Flow by 3D-LES](https://github.com/fschuch/the-plunging-flow-by-3D-LES): The Plunging of Hyperpycnal Plumes on Tilted Bed by Three-Dimensional Large-Eddy Simulations (EPTT, 2020).

* Tutorials (all in Portuguese):
  * [CFDPython](https://github.com/fschuch/CFDPython-BR) (*Translated to Portuguese*): A sequence of Jupyter notebooks featuring the "12 Steps to Navier-Stokes";
  * [Xarray - Python Brazil](https://github.com/fschuch/xarray-tutorial-python-brasil) (*Translated to Portuguese*): A 3h course presented at Python Brazil 2020 and 2021;
  * [Numerical Methods Applied to Heat Transfer](https://github.com/fschuch/Python-Transferencia-de-Calor) (*Author*);
  * [Numerical Methods in Python](https://github.com/fschuch/metodos-numericos-com-python) (*Author*).
