### About

I've been working in Computational Fluid Dynamics research for about ten years, applying and also developing tools that are often powered by High-Performance Computing (HPC).
I bring with me the experience of solving complex problems employing computational tools, besides processing, visualizing, and communicating the data produced by these solutions.

My main interests are High-performance computing, parallel computing, numerical methods, data science, data visualization, and technical writing.
